      "So sending an extra 'version' message is a minor transgression that is usually tolerated, sending an more than MAX_BLOCK_SIZE block is a major transgression.",
      "(PD) Detailed how-it-works, using \"I got a version message I wasn't expecting\" as the specific example:\r\n\r\nGetting a version message from a peer increases that peer's 'misbehaving' score by 10, and (assuming that is the peer's first bad behavior) gives it a 10% of being disconnected.",
      "(MD) If it is disconnected, then that peer's IP address is banned from connecting for a couple of hours.",
      "(MD) If it is not disconnected, then nothing happens unless the peer misbehaves again; if it does, then its chances of being disconnected go up, and the length of time it will be banned increases.",
      "(MD) Misbehavior/ban information is stored only in memory, and information about misbehaving peers is never broadcast.",
      "(PD) Also, peers that are disconnected/banned are just dropped, there is no warning or reason sent.",
      "(PD) I think this will eliminate a lot of potential denial-of-service attacks, and could be a good framework for responding to other potential attacks.",
      "(PD) \"We\" should still look through the code and limit the potential size of any data structures that an attacker might target (transaction pool, orphan block pool); the DoSprevention changes are meant to make  it harder for an attacker to stay connected long enough to pull off an attack.",
      "The danger is that I got something wrong; what if an attacker can leverage the DoSprevention code to split or shatter the network?",
      "(PD) Here's my thinking on that, please help check my work:\r\n\r\n+ I'm relying on TCP to prevent IP address spoofing (otherwise an attacker could force you to disconnect from your peers by pretending to be them and sending you a bad block).",
      "(MD) + Peers are only penalized for sending messages that won't, and shouldn't, get relayed.",
      "(MD) So an attacker shouldn't be able to poison the network with a bad message that is propogated and then causes everybody to disconnect from everybody else.",
      "(MD) + I specifically do not punish peers for relaying what look like double-spend transactions.",
      "(MD) If I did, then an attacker could try to segment the network into two pieces by broadcasting a series of double-spends from two halves of the network, and waiting until the nodes \"in the middle\" disconnected/banned across the 'seam'.",
      "So: please let me know if or how I'm being an idiot.",
      "(PD) I'm still thinking about the best way of testing this; at the very least, running a node for several days with this patch applied should result in a minimal number of \"disconnected %s for misbheavior\" messages in debug.log."

          "(P) The RDB would contain the name of the new AOF file, so when the RDB has been saved completely we can restore the data simply by loading the latest RDB and then reading from the AOF file that it points to.",
          "(P) As there can be several AOF files at the same time with this method, we need to number them in some way and (make  SURE) that we continue reading all the newer ones too (i.e.",
          "(M) those with a higher number).",
          "(P) Before the background save is completely done, we will therefore still be able to load our data by starting at an older RDB instead.",

          "(M) Whenever we start a background save we could always start a new AOF at the same time (why not?",
          "(P) ), so they would be closely linked.",
          "(P) We could safely remove old files when they are no longer needed (or allow the user to do something with them, like archiving them somewhere).",
          "(P) With just a little additional work we could also suport point-in-time-recovery (PITR) like e.g.",
          "PostgreSQL.",
          "(P) We just need to store a timestamp in the AOF each time we flush it (max one per second), have a timestamp in each RDB and then make  it possible to load up to a certain point (select the correct RDB if several and read the AOFs up to that point).",
          "(P) If you keep old AOFs and RDBs you would then always be able to restore data at any point in time :)\r\n\r\nIt would also be good because then there would be only a single algorithm to optimize for both background saves, slave syncs and AOF \"rewrites\", so everything would benefit from improvements and it would (perhaps) be easier to maintain.",
          "(P) For this to be as useful as possible, I think it's important to make  it easy to archive old AOFs and RDBs and perhaps even \r\nimplement PITR as described above (PITR would be awesome!",

      "(WD) In several places, Symfony creates a temporary file with `tempnam()`, renames it and chmods it to `0666 & ~umask()` (this string can be grepped).",
      "(WD) But when the `app/cache` directory is created with `chmod +a` or `setfacl` as per [the docs](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/installation.html#configuration-and-setup), the created file will be writable only by its creator.",
      "(WD) for example if the dir is `setfacl`'d to be writable by `smith` and `www-data`, files that `www-data` creates by this method will only be writable by `www-data`.",
      "(WD) This isn't a problem in normal operation, because if `smith` tries to create the file by the same method, the rename() is allowed to overwrite the old version even if it can't write into the file.",
      "(PD) But it can cause issues if `smith` wants to edit the file manually with a text editor, etc.",
      "(PD) So this is low priority, but it should be fixed if possible.",
      "(PD) To explain why the current method doesn't work, I need to explain how ACLs work in general.",
      "Sorry about the length.",
      "(PD) **Permissions of a newly created file:**\r\n\r\nStep 1: If the parent directory has a \"default ACL\" (essentially a template for new files inside it), use it as the new file's ACL.",
      "(PD) otherwise, set the ACL to \"everyone can do everything except stuff that's forbidden by the umask\".",
      "(PD) Step 2: Look at the \"mode\" argument of the function that's creating the file (open, creat, mkdir, ...) and when a bit is missing from the mode, also remove it from the ACL.",
      "(E.g.",
      "when mode is 0666, nobody will be able execute it.)",
      "(PD) The mode's first octal digit is about the file owner, and the third digit is about \"others\" (everyone not matched by any ACL rule), but the second number is a bit special: it's not just for the file group, it's a mask that covers all rules except the \"owner\" rule and the \"others\" rule.",
      "(PD) So if you open(\"file\", O_CREAT, 0644), it takes the default ACL, and it removes \"x\" from the \"owner\" rule and \"wx\" from all the other rules.",
      "**What this means for Symfony:**\r\n\r\nWhen Symfony does `0666 & ~umask()`, this isn't quite right.",
      "(PD) That's because as you'll notice above, when a directory has default ACL, umask doesn't enter the equation at all.",
      "(PD) The OS just uses the default ACL.",
      "(PD) If you chmod a file to `0644` and the file's ACL contains `u:www-data:rw-`, it'll effectively be just `r--`.",
      "(PD) Plus, this can actually give someone more privileges than they should have: If the default ACL says \"others have no access\", chmodding to `0666 & ~022` would allow \"others\" to read the file.",
      "(PD) (Perhaps this is a bigger problem than the above \"text editor\" example...)\r\n\r\nPHP has no functions for manipulating ACLs, so I think the only way to fix this is by completely avoiding chmod.",
      "(PD) And that means avoiding tempnam and just creating the file directly.",
      "(PD) (Perhaps you could use tempnam to generate a random filename, then delete it, then recreate it with normal permissions, but that seems a little too hacky.)",
      "(PD) What might be an issue is that tempnam has some nice exclusivity guarantees - maybe losing them would be a bigger problem than what this is trying to solve (which is, admittedly, very low priority)?",
      "I don't know.",
      "(WD) Uh, thanks for reading through all of this.",
      "(WD) Sorry that I don't have a better solution :-|"

      "(MD) This is an idea to build abstractions for bolts with fault-tolerant state (so if a task dies and gets reassigned to another machine it still has its state).",

      "(PD) This abstraction is actually independent to Storm, it should be done as a separate project or in storm-contrib.",
      "(PD) It does require a DFS with append functionality, which more recent versions of HDFS might provide (or MapR might provide it).",
      "(MD) The interface for a map-like state can look something like this:\r\n\r\nPersistentMap(String dfsDir) {\r\n  Object get(Object key)\r\n  void put(Object key, Object value);\r\n}\r\n\r\nUsing transactional topologies, it would probably look more like:\r\n\r\nPersistentMap(String dfsDir) {\r\n  Object get(Object key)\r\n  void putAll(Long txid, List<KeyValue> pairs);\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf you colocate your DFS with your Storm cluster, you should get data locality when writing.",
      "(MD) Having a pluggable scheduler can help with this as well.",
