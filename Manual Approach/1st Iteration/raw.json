      "Say you create a scene with mesh objects and apply a basic material to them.",
      "Because you've created the objects using the basic material, the geometry will never have normals generated for it as the basic material does not need it.",
      "(Along with most of the other attributes).",
      "From what I understand, just before the object is rendered to the screen it calls the initMeshBuffers function.",
      "This essentially creates the array buffers which later get used in the materials and shaders.",
      "The geometry by default has normals.",
      "but inside the initMeshBuffers function the __normalArray variable never gets set.",
      "(W)The reason is because just before it fills them, it looks at the material.",
      "If the material is basic it decides that the __normalArray buffer should not get filled - even if the geometry has normals.",
      " Let's say I now want to render the scene again (for a post process), but this time I use an override material on the renderer.",
      "This override material is a shader material and it does require normals.",
      " When the scene is being rendered, the renderer will apply the override material, however it will throw invalid pointer errors because the new shader requires normal attributes but the mesh geometry does not have any because it was created with a basic material.",
      "So how would I be able to achieve this second render pass?",
      " The first render has to use basic materials as anything more is overkill and could slow down the application.",
      "The second pass must contain normals as its rendering important information for a post process effect.",
      "I can't call needsupdate on the materials or geometry each time as its part of the render loop and having to rebuild them each frame will be hugely expensive.",
      " I guess the one approach would be to not use basic materials at all and insteadcreate my own shader material that uses a very basic program.",
